MODELS OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE - NOTES


Types of models seen
> Gravity models / study of trade frictions
> Application of (statistical) network analysis to trade networks
> Regression (correlation) models between GDP and trade
> Network wealth/asset exchange models
  - Similar flow concept
  - Stochastic / use noise

Wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product#Expenditure_approach
> The expenditure method of calculating GDP takes into account net exports (exports-imports)
> So by definition trade has a causal effect on GDP

*Lou - How Much of China and World GDP Has The Coronavirus Reduced? (2020)
> Uses input-output analysis to determine labor supply shock to China's GDP from COVID-19
> Then calculates effect of that on other countries' GDPs

*Hokkanen - Structure and Properties of Trade Networks
> Applied common graph metrics to the international trade network (ITN)
> Found correlations between some of these metrics and GDP

Bhattacharya - ITN Weighted Network Analysis and Modeling
> Not well written
> Examines distribution of bilateral trade flows
> Some relationship between trade volume and GDP exists

> Application of (statistical) network theory to trade networks
> No conclusions with real world significance

*Benedictis - The World Trade Network (2009)
> Summarizes history of network analysis for international trade, which dates back to the 1940s
> Analyzes the ITN over time using common network statistics

Garlaschelli - Structure and Evolution of the World Trade Network (2007)
> A fitness function between two nodes indicates likelihood of connection
> This fitness function is related to GDP
> No shit...it's called a gravity model

**Garlaschelli - Interplay between Topology and Dyamics in the WTN
> Discusses effects of GDP on the trade network, and vice versa
> For the latter, hypothesizes a stochastic network wealth exchange model as the cause of GDP distribution

Almog - Enhanced Gravity Model of Trade
> probability distribution related to bilateral trade volume
> tries to improve upon gravity models

> Models a contagion doomsday scenario using PageRank-CheiRank
> Considers countries and products

Ermann - Google Matrix of the World Trade Network (2011)
> Applies PageRank-CheiRank to the ITN
> Result sorts countries into three tiers

Algarra - A stochastic generative model of the World Trade Network
> Stochastic network formation model that approximates empirial ITN data
